Last edited 9th of June 2016

############################################

Requires python 3 or newer versions

**Updated June
- output csv as worm_analyzed.csv in experiment folder
- added GFP channel. Name of the tiff files should start with "GFP" 

**Status
Measuring amount of spots functional
Measuring length NOT functional

############################################


REQUIRED INSTALLED PACKAGES
- numpy
- pyQT4
- matplotlib
- copy
- skimage
- pickle
- PIL
- scipy
- glob
- tifffile (tifffile script is added in case the package can not be installed)


SCRIPTS
- smFISH_beta 		(main script)
- dialog.py		(first dialog for giving more information on labels and channels)
- FindmRNA.py		(functions for finding spots/regions in 3D, adjusting images)
- graphdialog.py	(second dialog presenting graph, number of spots vs. threshold)
- Images_worm.py	(functions for loading images of the worms)
- LogFilter.py		(function replacing matlab fspecial function with LoG)
- Main_calculations.py	(containing the main object)
- mainwindow.ui		(user interface of the main window)
- mRNA_counting.py	(functions for calculating the amount of spots in 3d)
- test_CC.py		(function for finding regions in 3D, replacing matlab function)


CONTROLS
General controls
[q, w, e, r] - z-stack [-1, +1, -5, +5]
scroll mouse - move up or down in z-stacks
[z, x, c] - channels
delete - remove POI, ROI, thershold point
POI controls
right mouse button - open label list
left mouse button - add label
ROI controls
enter - next label
[=] - copy ROI from below
[-] - copy ROI from above


SHORT GUIDE
smFISH_beta is the main script for starting the interface
1 "File" -> "Open new" for starting a new project you need to select the folder containing "worm" folders. 
2 Start with annotating POI for each of the worms. Project can be saved at any time
3 Then annotate the ROI for each of the worms for each of the labels
4 The threshold is set while looking at the first label in each of the worms. The set button saves 
the threshold and if there are more channels, it will switch to the next channel.
5 Calculate the spots in the other labels in each of the worms for all available channels (excl DAPI).
6 Save project. Now all data can be found in the saved object written in dictionaries


SAVED OBJECT plk
WormPaths  			(all paths of images)
images *empty when saved	
POI				(Point of interest - worm ["x,y,label"])
ROI				(Region of interest - worm - label - z-stack ["x,y,label"]
list_worms
labels				
labels_l 			(when length is measured, not functional yet!)
channels
exp_folder
spots				(found spots - worm - channel - label)


REMARKS
Image file names should be in the format: "Channel" + *
Channel names: DAPI, Cy5 or Alexa594. 
The channel names can be replaced by changing MainCal object - channels "DAPI" or by replacing 
the labels in DialogInput object - checkboxes

Interfaces are made with PyQt designer
